        <h2>About Me...</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Daniel Boley. Most people call me Dan. I'm originally from South Brunswick, New Jersey (the town sandwiched between Princeton University and Rutgers University). I attended Fairfield University, where I graduated with a B.A. degree in Economics. I also minored in English, Philosophy, Communications. I currently live in Stamford, Connecticut with my wife, Kathleen, and our dog, Finn.</p>
        <h2>Interests...</h2>
            <h3>Music</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Concerts</li>
                        <p>I absolutely love live music and attending concerts. I've been to hundreds of concerts and I have the ticket stub for every concert I've ever attended.</p>
                    <li>Vinyl</li>
                        <p>I also collect music in the hip, modern format of vinyl records. I currently have around 700 records in my collection.</p>
                    <li>Streaming & Sharing</li>
                        <p>Nothing can beat the convience of streaming, and I love having the perfect playlist for all occasions.</p>
                </ul>
            <h3>Running</h3>
                <p>I enjoy running... Yes, for fun! Follow me on Strava for endless kudos!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>My last race: 2021 NYC Marathon</li>
                    <li>My next race: Hudson River 50</li>
                    <li>My favorite race: First State Trail Race</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Hiking</h3>
                <p>There's nothing quite like fresh air at the top of a mountain!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>My first hike: Camel's Hump (Green Mountains, VT)</li>
                    <li>My last hike: Cadillac Mountain (Acadia National Park, ME)</li>
                    <li>My dream hike: Presidential Traverse (White Mountains, NH)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Skiing</h3>
                <p>Though I would say I'm amatuer at best, I love skiing. My friends and I take a ski trip out west every year to a new destination. Our trips feature opening and closing ceremonies, awards, and many more absurdly intricate, unnecessary traditions. We even wrote and published a (joke) rule book about the tenets of big mountain shredding.</p>
                <p>Previous ski trips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Big Sky, Montana (2019)</li>
                    <li>Jackson Hole, Wyoming (2020)</li>
                    <li>Solitude, Brighton, Snowbird, & Alta, Utah (2021)</li>
                    <li>Telluride, Colorado (2022)</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Beer</h3>
                <p>I think this one is pretty self explanitory. Ales, Lagers, Sours, Stouts, etc. If it's got some combination of barley, yeast, hops, and water, I'd like a sip please!</p>
